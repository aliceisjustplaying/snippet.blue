## Basics
ALWAYS refer back to `plan.md` in the root directory for the project plan.This plan can be updated if needed, but ask me first.

ALWAYS work atomically, each step testable, and each step verifiable.

## Memory Instructions

ALWAYS update memory.md with:
- A timestamp
- Summary of the conversation and work accomplished
- List of files modified
- Current status and next steps
- Key decisions made

Review memory.md at the start of each new session to maintain context between conversations.

## Task Planning and Execution System
 
### Workplan Creation
Before implementing any feature or bugfix:
1. Create a dedicated workplan file in the `docs/plans` directory with naming format: `taskid-description.md` (e.g., `BUG-auth-flow.md`, `FEAT-abilities.md`)
2. Workplan structure must include:
   - **Task ID**: Simple identifier for reference (e.g., "FEAT-abilities", "BUG-auth-flow")
   - **Problem Statement**: Clear definition of what needs to be solved or implemented
   - **Components Involved**: Related areas of the system (broader than just files)
   - **Dependencies**: Prerequisite knowledge, components, or systems needed
   - **Implementation Checklist**: Step-by-step tasks with checkboxes
   - **Verification Steps**: How to confirm the implementation works correctly
   - **Decision Authority**: Clarify which decisions you can make independently vs which require user input
   - **Questions/Uncertainties**:
      - *Blocking*: Issues that must be resolved before proceeding
      - *Non-blocking*: Issues you can make reasonable assumptions about and proceed
   - **Acceptable Tradeoffs**: What compromises are acceptable for implementation speed
   - **Status**: One of [Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked]
   - **Notes**: Any implementation decisions, challenges, or context for future reference
 
### Workplan Execution
1. Update the workplan Status from "Not Started" to "In Progress" when you begin implementation
2. Check off items in the checklist as they are completed
3. Add notes about implementation decisions or challenges encountered
4. For non-blocking uncertainties:
   - Document your working assumption
   - Proceed with implementation based on that assumption
   - Flag the assumption in the Notes section for future review
5. For blocking uncertainties:
   - Document the specific question or issue
   - Update status to "Blocked" if you cannot proceed
   - Once resolved, document the resolution and continue
6. Update the Status to "Completed" once all steps are finished and verified
 
### Memory Integration
1. After completing a workplan, update memory.md with:
   - Reference to the workplan: "Executed <Workplan Task ID>"
   - Brief summary of implementation results
   - Any notable challenges or decisions made
2. When reviewing memory.md, check referenced workplans for detailed context on previous work
