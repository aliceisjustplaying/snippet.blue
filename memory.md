# Memory Log

## Memory Entry: 2025-05-16

**Summary of Conversation and Work Accomplished:**

Completed the Lexicon Setup phase (Step 2 of `plan.md`) as detailed in `docs/plans/INIT-project-setup.md`. This involved generating TypeScript types from `lexicons/blue.snippet.code.snippet.json`.

Key achievements:

1. **Troubleshooting `pnpm`**: Resolved `pnpm` execution issues using `npx pnpm@<version>`.
2. **Correcting Package Name**: Used `@atproto/lex-cli`.
3. **Lexicon CLI Command**: Used `lex gen-ts-obj lexicons/blue.snippet.code.snippet.json > src/lexicon-types.ts`.
4. **Lexicon JSON Structure**: Corrected `lexicons/blue.snippet.code.snippet.json` (e.g., `defs.main.record.type` to `"object"`).
5. **Code Snippet Size Limit**: Updated `lexicons/blue.snippet.code.snippet.json` and `plan.md` to set `properties.code.maxLength` to `65536` (64KB) based on AT Protocol's byte-based `maxLength` for strings.
6. **Output File Extension**: Ensured lexicon output is `src/lexicon-types.ts`.
7. **Successful Type Generation**: Successfully generated `src/lexicon-types.ts` (including the 64KB limit update).
8. **Verification**: Verified generated TypeScript types using `npx ts-node -e "require('./src/lexicon-types'); console.log('TypeScript types ok - 64KB limit')"`.
9. **Workplan Completion**: `docs/plans/INIT-project-setup.md` status is 'Completed'.

**List of Files Modified:**

* `docs/plans/INIT-project-setup.md` (status and checklist updates)
* `plan.md` (updated lexicon definition for `code.maxLength`)
* `package.json` (updated `lex:gen` script to output `.ts`)
* `lexicons/blue.snippet.code.snippet.json` (updated `code.maxLength` to 65536)
* `src/lexicon-types.ts` (regenerated file with 64KB limit)

**Current Status and Next Steps:**

* **Current Status**: Lexicon setup (Step 2 of `plan.md`) is complete, including the 64KB code snippet limit.
* **Next Steps**: Proceed with Step 3 of `plan.md`: "Test-publish script".

**Key Decisions Made:**

* Used `npx pnpm@<version>` to overcome local `pnpm` execution issues.
* Switched from `@atproto/cli` to `@atproto/lex-cli`.
* Adjusted lexicon generation command and JSON structure iteratively based on errors.
* Outputted lexicon types as `src/lexicon-types.ts` for direct TypeScript usage.
* Used `ts-node` for verifying `.ts` lexicon output.
* Confirmed AT Protocol lexicon `maxLength` for strings is byte-based and set `code` property to 65536 bytes (64KB).

## Session Summary - 2024-05-17T<TIMESTAMP>

**Work Accomplished**

* Executed workplan `REFACTOR-lexicon-id`.
* Changed lexicon identifier from `blue.snippet.code.snippet` to `blue.snippet.code`.
* Renamed lexicon file from `lexicons/blue.snippet.code.snippet.json` to `lexicons/blue.snippet.code.json`.
* Updated `package.json` (lex:gen script).
* Regenerated `src/lexicon-types.ts`.
* Updated `scripts/create-test-snippet.ts` to use the new lexicon ID.
* Updated main project plan (`plan.md`) and workplans (`docs/plans/INIT-project-setup.md`, `docs/plans/FEAT-test-publish-script.md`) to reflect the changes.

**Files Modified**

* `lexicons/blue.snippet.code.json` (renamed from `lexicons/blue.snippet.code.snippet.json`)
* `package.json`
* `src/lexicon-types.ts`
* `scripts/create-test-snippet.ts`
* `plan.md`
* `docs/plans/INIT-project-setup.md`
* `docs/plans/FEAT-test-publish-script.md`
* `docs/plans/REFACTOR-lexicon-id.md`
* `memory.md` (this update)

**Current Status & Next Steps**

* Refactoring of lexicon ID complete.
* Next step is to verify the changes by running the test script: `pnpm tsx scripts/create-test-snippet.ts`.

**Key Decisions Made**

* Decided to proceed with the lexicon ID refactoring as planned.
* Addressed markdown linting issues in `plan.md` that arose during edits.
